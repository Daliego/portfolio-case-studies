## The Magic Roots

A 2D local multiplayer platformer built with Godot Engine 3, created during a game jam. Two players must cooperate to solve puzzles, avoid traps, and collect magical roots before time runs out. Each level can be completed by reaching the final portal, but collecting roots increases the score and rewards up to three stars.

### Overview

In each stage, players work together to overcome obstacles and complete objectives under a time limit. The game encourages coordination, since both characters share the same environment and must combine movement and timing to progress.

### Gameplay

- Local co-op for two players on the same machine
- Puzzle driven levels with traps and obstacles
- Time limited stages
- Optional collectible system that affects scoring
- Collect all roots to earn three stars
- Finish by reaching the portal without collecting roots to unlock the next level, but earn no stars for that stage
