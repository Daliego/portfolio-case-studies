##### Project Overview

A small learning project I built to explore how to create a **typing-like animation** and animate the **transition of letters** on a page using **vanilla JavaScript**. The main goal was to practice core JS fundamentals, especially **timing and sequencing**, by implementing different animation behaviors with `setTimeout` (and iterative updates to the DOM).

This project was inspired by the [Decryption Simulation App](https://decryption-simulation-app.vercel.app/), which simulates a "password decryption" effect done by me. After finishing this application, I challenged myself to recreate the animation using my own knowledge, then later applied what I learned to an older project I had built with **Romero Mendonça** and **Werton Silva** - the [AssinaAí (Checkin Now!)](/personal-work/assina-ai/) laboratory attendance system.

##### What I Practiced / Implemented

- Letter-by-letter text updates (typing effect)
- Character replacement / "scramble" transitions (decrypt-like feel)
- Timing control with `setTimeout` chains
- DOM manipulation for smooth visual updates
- Small feature experiments to understand animation trade-offs (speed, readability, pacing)

##### Technology Stack

- **Language:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Concepts:** DOM manipulation, timing functions (`setTimeout`), string manipulation, animation sequencing
- **No frameworks or libraries** - pure JavaScript implementation

---

##### Project Context

This was a learning-focused project to deepen my understanding of:
- JavaScript timing and sequencing
- DOM manipulation techniques
- Animation principles and trade-offs
- Recreating effects from scratch without relying on libraries

The project demonstrates practical application of core JavaScript concepts in creating engaging visual effects.
