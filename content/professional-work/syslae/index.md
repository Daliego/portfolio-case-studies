##### Company Overview

During my time at Syslae, I worked on several products and projects. Initially, I focused on backend development with the integration of a Laravel application with a Django microservice used for interacting with the ChatGPT API.

**Introduction**: Developed a Django-based microservice integrated with a Laravel application, leveraging Grok and ChatGPT APIs to process official documents and generate standardized responses.

I also maintained and updated existing React Native mobile apps and React.js web systems. Additionally, I built a school management system (Education) using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui (project not launched during my company time).

Throughout my tenure, I delivered both new features and bug fixes for multiple production systems across different tech stacks.
