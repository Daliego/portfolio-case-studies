##### Project Overview

Ponto PI is a React Native app with development managed by my senior [Monuery Junior](https://www.linkedin.com/in/monnueryj/?originalSubdomain=br). The app's goal is to record and manage employee work hours with accuracy and compliance.

Ponto PI is a tool used to record, control, and manage employee work hours in an organization. It can be implemented in different ways, including manual, mechanical, digital, or biometric systems, depending on the company's needs. The main function of this system is to ensure accuracy and compliance with labor laws, in addition to optimizing human resources management.

I joined the project to maintain the codebase and develop new modules. The app was built with React Native and related tools, focusing on reliability, clear workflows, and an efficient experience for organizations.
