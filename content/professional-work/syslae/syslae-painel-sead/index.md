##### Project Overview

The SEAD Panel is a web platform used to manage administrative processes for the State Secretariat of Administration (SEAD) of Piauí. The platform includes login through gov.br, custom indicators, informational panels, and document viewing in PDF, HTML, or image formats.

The project was originally created by my senior [Monuery Junior](https://www.linkedin.com/in/monnueryj/?originalSubdomain=br). I worked on the system by building new features and keeping the platform updated.
