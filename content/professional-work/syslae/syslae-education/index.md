##### Project Overview

**Summary**: A comprehensive school management platform that centralizes academic and administrative workflows, providing real-time performance monitoring, attendance tracking, and efficient communication tools.

Education: Simplifying school management for a bright future.

During my time at Syslae, I contributed to the development of the Education app, a full platform focused on school management. The platform centralizes academic and administrative workflows, providing a comprehensive solution for educational institutions.

Education is the complete solution for school management, integrating all administrative and pedagogical needs into a single platform. You can monitor students' academic performance in real-time, register and track school attendance, and generate detailed reports that facilitate analysis and decision-making.

Additionally, our platform offers efficient communication with real-time notifications, an updated calendar with school events and activities, and interaction channels between teachers, students, and parents. This ensures that everyone is always informed and engaged in the educational process.

**Note**: The project was not launched during my time at the company, but significant development work was completed.
